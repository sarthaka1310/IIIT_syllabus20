# IIIT Hyderabad Curriculum and Syllabus

This is an archive of the syllabus and course offerings for ALL UG branches in IIIT-H maintained by an IIITian.

This [Handbook](/Curriculum%20Handbook/UG-Dual_Curricula-2018.pdf) provides detailed explanation of the course structure and requirements for all UG and DD branches (except CHD, which is similar to CLD and CND).
###### NOTE: If you do not understand something, going through this Handbook will mostly solve your problem, else ask at [Counselling Forum](https://www.facebook.com/groups/iiithcounsellingforum/?ref=nf_target&fref=nf&__tn__=C-R)

There are two 4-month semesters in each academic year. The first semester for a student is a Monsoon semester (August-November) and then follows a Spring semester (January-April) and so on. 

Note: The curriculum and Semester structure for UG2020 was an exception.
