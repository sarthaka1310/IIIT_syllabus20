# IIIT Hyderabad Curriculum and Syllabus

This is an archive of the syllabus and course offerings for ALL branches in IIIT-H maintained by an IIITian.

This [Handbook](/Curriculum%20Handbook/UG-Dual_Curricula-2018.pdf) provides detailed explanation of the course structure and requirements for all UG and DD branches (except CHD, which is similar to CLD and CND).
## NOTE: If you do not understand something, going through this Handbook will mostly solve your problem, else ask at [Counselling Forum](https://www.facebook.com/groups/iiithcounsellingforum/?ref=nf_target&fref=nf&__tn__=C-R)

The first semester for a student is a monsoon semester and then follows a spring semester and so on (The first semester for me, a CHD2k19 student, was Monsoon 2019)

The latest curriculum is [Monsoon2020](/M'20/ProgWiseCourseOfferings-M20-V1.pdf) and syllabi for core courses at [Monsoon Core](/M'20/UG-Core-Syllabus-M20-V2.pdf) electives at [Monsoon electives](/M'20/Elective-Syllabus-M20-V2.pdf) for the first, third,... semester since it is for the Monsoon semester. The HSME electives for Monsoon'20 are listed [here](/M'20/HSME-Courses-M20.pdf)
If you want the courses for the second, fourth,... semester, it is at [Spring2020](/S'20/Course%20Offerings-S20-V3.pdf) and their syllabi at [Spring20 syllabus](S'20/Syllabus%20for%20UG-Core%20and%20Elective%20courses-S20-V2.pdf) The HSME electives for Spring'20 are listed [here](/S'20/HSME_Courses-S2020.pdf)
